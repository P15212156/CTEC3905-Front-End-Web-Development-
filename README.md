##Submission Description
This is an assignment submission by Christopher Millett P15212156. The theme of my website is personal privacy, 
namely how individuals may ensure their privacy remains intact online and in the real world.

##Content of Website
Most of the content of my website is Lorem Ipsum, with the exception of headings and images which fit the theme.

All images used were either created by me or found on Creative Commons and are thus free for non-commercial use.

##Design Process
At this link: https://imgur.com/a/gkSR7 there are photos of rough sketches I did plus notes I made regarding ideas for styles and the layout.

My website contains CSS, HTML and a small PHP script to demonstrate functionality I would have liked to add in the future, which takes inputs from users
and generates a table from it. This could have been used to email these inputs to myself had I implemented this.

My HTML AND CSS have both been validated and produce no errors.

I ran into one error caused by an open curly brace in my stylesheet which ruined around half of my styles and caused a great deal of stress
in order to resolve, but it has since been dealt with so containers should sit where I put them.
